## Learning Algorithm

DQN, Double DQN, Dueling DQN, Prioritized Experience Replay are used for this project.

DQN model is built with Linear layers and Relu activation functions. 4 Layers of size 256 each proved to be the best performing.

Dueling DQN model is built with 4 Layers of size 256 each for Features, and 2 layers of size 128 for Advantage and Value.
